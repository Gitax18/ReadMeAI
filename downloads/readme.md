## Code Explanation

The following is an explanation of the code for the calculator:

The `index.js` file contains the main logic for the calculator. The file starts by defining two variables, `a` and `b`, to store the two numbers that the user enters. The file then uses the `prompt()` function to get the two numbers from the user.

Once the two numbers have been entered, the file uses the `console.log()` function to print the following to the console:

- The sum of the two numbers
- The subtraction of the two numbers
- The product of the two numbers
- The division of the two numbers
