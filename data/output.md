## Code

The code for this project is located in the `src` directory. The following is a list of the files in the `src` directory:

- `index.js`: This file contains the main code for the project.
- `utils.js`: This file contains utility functions that are used in the project.

## Code Explanation

The following is an explanation of the code in the `index.js` file:

```
const a = 2;
const b = 3;

const sum = a + b;
const product = a * b;

console.log(`The sum of ${a} and ${b} is ${sum}`);
console.log(`The product of ${a} and ${b} is ${product}`);
```

The first two lines of code declare two variables, `a` and `b`, and assign them the values of 2 and 3, respectively. The next two lines of code calculate the sum and product of `a` and `b`, and store the results in the variables `sum` and `product`, respectively. The final two lines of code print the sum and product of `a` and `b` to the console.
