### Installation

To install this project, you will need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Node.js
- NPM

Once you have the dependencies installed, you can install the project by running the following command:

```
npm install
```

### Usage

To use this project, you can import the `index.js` file into your project. Once you have imported the file, you can use the following code to add two numbers and print the sum and product of the two numbers:

```
const a = 2;
const b = 3;

const sum = a + b;
const product = a * b;

console.log(`The sum of ${a} and ${b} is ${sum}`);
console.log(`The product of ${a} and ${b} is ${product}`);
```

### Code

```
const a = 2;
const b = 3;

const sum = a + b;
const product = a * b;

console.log(`The sum of ${a} and ${b} is ${sum}`);
console.log(`The product of ${a} and ${b} is ${product}`);
```

### Code Explanation

This code snippet is a simple example of how to add two numbers and print the sum and product of the two numbers. The first step is to define the two numbers that you want to add. In this case, we have defined the numbers `a` and `b` as `2` and `3`, respectively.

The next step is to add the two numbers together and multiply them together. We do this by using the following code:

```
const sum = a + b;
const product = a * b;
```

Once we have added the two numbers together and multiplied them together, we can print the results to the console. We do this by using the following code:

```
console.log(`The sum of ${a} and ${b} is ${sum}`);
console.log(`The product of ${a} and ${b} is ${product}`);
```
