**Installation**

To install this project, you will need to have Node.js installed on your computer. You can download Node.js from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Once Node.js is installed, you can install this project by running the following command in your terminal:

```
npm install @project-title/core
```

This will install the project's dependencies and create a `node_modules` folder in your current directory.

**Usage**

To use this project, you can import the `Calculator` class from the `@project-title/core` package. For example:

```js
import { Calculator } from '@project-title/core';

const calculator = new Calculator();

const sum = calculator.add(2, 3);
const product = calculator.multiply(2, 3);

console.log(`The sum of 2 and 3 is ${sum}`);
console.log(`The product of 2 and 3 is ${product}`);
```

**Code**

The following code snippet shows the implementation of the `Calculator` class:

```js
class Calculator {
  constructor() {
    this._sum = 0;
    this._product = 1;
  }

  add(a, b) {
    this._sum = this._sum + a + b;
    return this._sum;
  }

  multiply(a, b) {
    this._product = this._product * a * b;
    return this._product;
  }
}
```

**Code Explanation**

The `Calculator` class has two properties: `_sum` and `_product`. These properties are used to store the sum and product of the two numbers that are passed to the `add()` and `multiply()` methods, respectively.

The `add()` method adds the two numbers that are passed to it and returns the sum. The `multiply()` method multiplies the two numbers that are passed to it and returns the product.
