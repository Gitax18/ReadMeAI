- `styles.css`: This file contains the CSS for the calculator UI.

## Code Explanation

The following is an explanation of the code snippets you included above:

```
// Calculate the sum of two numbers
const sum = (a, b) => a + b;

// Calculate the product of two numbers
const product = (a, b) => a * b;

// Get the user input
const getNumbers = () => {
  const a = parseInt(document.getElementById('a').value);
  const b = parseInt(document.getElementById('b').value);

  return [a, b];
};

// Perform the mathematical operation
const calculate = (numbers) => {
  const [a, b] = numbers;

  const result = sum(a, b);

  // Print the result to the console
  console.log(result);
};

// Handle the user input
document.getElementById('calculate').addEventListener('click', () => {
  const numbers = getNumbers();

  calculate(numbers);
});
